This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component.  The `current` property of the ref might be unexpectedly `null` even after the component has mounted and rendered. This often happens when trying to access the ref's value within a callback function, or when the component re-renders before the ref has been properly assigned.
